Getting and Cleaning Data  Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected. 

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

Files list:
tidyData.csv data set  with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
README.MD
CodeBook.MD :  List all the variables and summaries you calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information
run_analysis.R: The script to be run to get the intended results

Usage

    Clone this repository: with git clone https://github.com/michelemostarda/cousera-getting-cleaning.git
    Move in repo dir
    Load run_analysis.R in your R environment
    Run function runAnalysis()

It will

    download the dataset archive
    unzip it
    process it and (re-)generate the tidy.csv file (also included in commit).

For further details please refer the source code itself.
